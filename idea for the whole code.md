only had a bit of free time before I go study for an exam tom, here's what I have an idea so far of what we could do:

1.) Use this code as our main reference/source of code: https://www.scaler.com/topics/dfs-python/

2.) What we could do to tweak it are:

-> Simple main menu 

 a.) 1st option: Showcase the existing graph
Showcase the step by step of what the graph looks like while the code is running (i.e. in output: line 1 shows the DFS graph is {0}, then line 2 shows the DFS graph is {0, 2}, and it goes on until the code is finish running) [We can refer to the main source of code, and maybe add a for loop]

 b.) 2nd option: Add/Edit nodes
Make a user input if they want to add another number in the state space. If possible and HIGHLY needed, they can edit the existing nodes

c.) 3rd option: Exit
Terminate the code to exit
