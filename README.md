THINGS TO DO:

[] code
    [] Students need to choose one (1) search algorithm and write a program in any programming language to simulate the optimal path finding.
    [] The algorithm should be dynamic that it is able to change the behavior if the goal state is changed or if the state space is changed. The minimum depth for the search is 4 (d3).
    [] Students need to apply their creativity in the program to interact with users and display the output.

[] report
    [] Title Page
        • A page containing the members of the group
    [] Introduction
        • Describe the chosen algorithm. You may use figures for illustration.
    [] Pseudocode
        • Explain in detail the process that you used in translating the real-world information into formulas in the knowledge base. Cite examples.
    [] Results and Analysis
        • Provide the screenshot with explanations.
        • Summarize the strengths and limitations. Provide suggestions for the limitations (if any).
    [] References
        • Use APA citation format.
    [] Contributions of Each Members
        • Explain in detail the contribution of each group member in the completion of the project.


REMINDERS
    1. The executable program (ready to run). This should be in a folder named *app*. If there are additional files needed for the program to run, make sure to include them. Include in this folder the instructions needed to run the program. Include instructions on how to use it as well if it’s not intuitive from the program itself like a *README.txt file*.
    2. The complete source codes used for the program. Put these in a folder named *source*.
    3. The pdf document containing the report name it *report.pdf*.
    4. These are to be submitted as a single zip file with a filename of MCO2_<surname 1>_<surname 2>_<surname 3>_<surname 4>.zip. Please make sure that you comply with the naming conventions and format of the submission.
