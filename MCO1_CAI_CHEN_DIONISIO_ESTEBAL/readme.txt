 
For windows, please click the batch file (run.bat) to run the program. For others, it is required for the user to use python compiler software. 

Once the user has a software to open and run the code, an output prompt will showcase a main menu that the code has to offer.

The main menu of the code consists of 6 options to choose from:
1.) Inputting of nodes in the graph
 => For the user to run this option in the program, they must type "a" to enter the part of the program to input nodes into the graph. Once the user is in, the program will ask the user to input a parent node to be identified in the graph. Afterwards, user will be asked to enter a child node of their choice to be inserted in the graph. The graph will consist of numbers only, so the user must input only integers to be inserted in the graph. Lastly, the user has the option to pick the child node's position wherein 0 being the first position, 1 being the second position, and so on. Once inputted, the graph will then be updated with the inputs that the user has given. Afterwards, the program will add the node entered by the user and will be returned to the main menu. 

2.) Deleting a node in the graph
 => For the user to run this option in the program, they must type "b" to enter the part of the program to delete a node that is in the graph. Once the user is in, the program will ask the user to input the node that they are willing to delete in the current existing graph. Afterwards, the program will delete the node entered by the user and will be returned to the main menu. 

3.) Editing a node in the graph
 => For the user to run this option in the program, they must type "c" to enter the part of the program to edit a node that is in the graph. Once the user is in, the program will ask the user to input the node that they are willing to edit in the current existing graph to replace with another value of their choosing. Afterwards, the program will edit the node entered by the user and replace it with the value that has been newly inputted by the user. Then, they will be returned to the main menu. 

4.) Showcasing of current graph
 => For the user to run this option in the program, they must type "d" to enter the part of the program that can showcase the current existing graph that the output has at the moment. To identify it easily, the numbers on the left side of the output showcases the parent nodes while the numbers that follow after are its respective child nodes. Then, they will be returned to the main menu. 

5.) Depth First Search
 => For the user to run this option in the program, they must type "e" to enter the part of the program wherein the user can see a depth first search based on the input they would want to see. The program will ask the user to input the start node for the Depth First Search traversal, then will ask for the goal node. The program will then proceed to do a Depth First Search on the input that the user has given. Then, they will be returned to the main menu. 

6.) Exiting the program
 => For the user to run this option in the program, they must type "f" to terminate the code in order to stop the code from running further once they are finished.
