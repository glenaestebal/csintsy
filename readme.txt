This code is a program that is implemented through python language, so it is required for the user to use python compiler software. Once the user has a software to open and run the code, an output prompt will showcase a main menu that the code has to offer.

The main menu of the code consists of 4 options to choose from:
1.) Inputting of nodes in the graph
 => For the user to run this option in the program, they must type "a" to enter the part of the program to input nodes into the graph. Once the user is in, the program will ask the user to input a parent node to be identified in the graph. Afterwards, user will be asked to enter a child node of their choice to be inserted in the graph. The graph will consist of numbers only, so the user must input only integers to be inserted in the graph. Lastly, the user has the option to pick the child node's position wherein 0 being the first position, 1 being the second position, and so on. Once inputted, the graph will then be updated with the inputs that the user has given.

2.) Showcasing of current graph
 => For the user to run this option in the program, they must type "b" to enter the part of the program that can showcase the current existing graph that the output has at the moment. To identify it easily, the numbers on the left side of the output showcases the parent nodes while the numbers that follow after are its respective child nodes. 

3.) Depth First Search
 => For the user to run this option in the program, they must type "c" to enter the part of the program wherein the user can see a depth first search based on the input they would want to see. The program will ask the user to input the start node for the Depth First Search traversal, then will ask for the goal node. The program will then proceed to do a Depth First Search on the input that the user has given.

4.) Exiting the program
 => For the user to run this option in the program, they must type "d" to terminate the code in order to stop the code from running further once they are finished.
